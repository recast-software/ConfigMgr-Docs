# Windows Customizations

This Section will be dedicated to Windows Customizations, Branding and Tweaks. Items will include Explorer tweaks, setting the Wallpaper and Lock Screen images, Windows Profile Image replacement, and whatever else we think of.  Much of this material is born out of a MMS session that two of our team members (Gary Blok & Mark Godfrey) would present on regularly.

Items we're covering are mostly all PowerShell driven, so you can deploy them via Intune, ConfigMgr, or other processes.

Things covered:

- Changing Default Background Images
- Changing Default Lock Screen Images
- Adding "This PC" Icon to Desktop and renaming "This PC" to the actual PC Name
- Modifying Quick Access Folders
- Creating Shortcuts with PowerShell
