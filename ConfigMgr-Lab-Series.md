## Recast Lab Build Out

Here is a lab I build for using here at Recast, as I was building it out, I took time to document it along the way as I often need to reference what I did when I set things up, and since I was taking time, thought I'd share.

## Microsoft Supplied Lab Kit

[Microsoft has a lab kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/modern-desktop-deployment-and-management-lab?view=o365-worldwide) you can download and built on a hyper V server.  It has all the pieces you need to start testing.  I've used this a few times as "throw away labs" that I want to reproduce a test on a lab that is not my own to confirm something works, or a bug.
