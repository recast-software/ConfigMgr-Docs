Well this step is deprecated.  I wasn't able to find any information about it and I reached out to the MS Docs person for CM, and he pointed out that the step was deprecated in 1710, so I'm not going to bother going over this step, I was starting to use it in my task sequence to learn more about it, but since no one will be using it, no point... 

so with that, nothing to see here folks, move along.
