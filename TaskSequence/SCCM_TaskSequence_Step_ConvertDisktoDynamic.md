# Convert Disk to Dynamic

This step is deprecated and no longer supported.  The docs for this step do not exist.  It was [deprecated in CM 1710](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-cmfeatures).

I personally have never had a need for this step, and if you do, please contact me with your use case, and I'd be happy to append information to this post.
