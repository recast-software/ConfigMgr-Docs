# Manufacturer Tools - HP - ConfigMgr

## **DRAFT**

There are several ways you can leverage these tools, and it's going to be completely different based on your environment and business requirements.  Perhaps you want all of the content coming from your distribution points, and tightly managed bandwidth, or perhaps you want all of the updates coming from Dell so you don't have to manage that.  In these posts, we're going to leverage the ability to go back Dell, and not create packages in CM with all of the content.

This will be broken into several sub pages, as I found it was too much content of a single post, and will separate the tools into more bite size chunks.

Table of Contents:

- Using HP Tools with ConfigMgr (OSD & Baselines & Run Scripts)
  - Automating Install of HPIA & HPCMSL
  - Automating Update of BIOS
  - Managing BIOS Settings


## Run Scripts

### Update BIOS
